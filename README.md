This project involves computer simulation of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Through working on this project, we learn the details of PCR and computer simulation techniques. The purpose of [**PCR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) is to make huge number of copies of a DNA segment. There are three major steps in PCR: denaturizing, annealing and elongation.
